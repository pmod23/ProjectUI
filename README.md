# ProjectUI

Description

For this project, I used the Modal pattern and the NASA API. This API is designed to collect image data gathered by NASA's Mars rover, Opportunity.

Once each componenet or block is clicked, the user is able to see a "modal info" that contains launch-date, landing-date, and active-status for a total of 6 objects(pictures).

This project required HTML, CSS, Javascript and the integration of an API
